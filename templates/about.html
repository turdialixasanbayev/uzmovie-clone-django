        <p>
          Uzmovi Clone is a movie streaming platform built for demonstration purposes. 
          Our mission is to provide users with the best movie browsing experience, 
          including the latest releases, popular titles, and user-curated wishlists.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is a learning clone of the original <strong>uzmovi.tv</strong> 
          website, developed using <span class="text-warning">Django</span> and 
          <span class="text-warning">Bootstrap</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here you can explore movies by categories, watch trailers, and save your favorite 
          titles in your personal wishlist.
